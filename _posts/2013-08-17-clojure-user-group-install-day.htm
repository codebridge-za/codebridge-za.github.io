<h2>Clojure User Group :: Install Day :: Saturday, 17th August 2013, 9am to 5pm</h2>

<p>Bring your laptop, and we'll get you set up to hack on Clojure and ClojureScript!</p>

<p>For those who are keen, we'll also get you set up with Emacs and provide a suitable configuration for Clojure development and walk through enough basics to get you started.</p>

<p>There'll be plenty of time for Q&A as well.</p>
