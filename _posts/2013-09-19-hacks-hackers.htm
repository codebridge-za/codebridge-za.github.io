<h2>The Hacks/Hackers Cape Town re-launch meetup</h2>

<p>Hey folks!</p>

<p>We’re getting Hacks/Hackers Cape Town up and running again, and we’re kicking it off with a meeting on Thursday, 19 September at CodeBridge in Claremont. </p>

<p>The first meeting will focus on the future direction of Hacks/Hackers Cape Town. We’ll report on what other Hacks/Hackers chapters are doing, show off the Salary Survey project, see what type of meetings you guys are interested in (talks, hackathons, master classes etc), set a day for regular monthly meetups, explain the setup of Hacks/Hackers internationally and locally, and of course drink some beer and chat to great people.</p>

<p>We’re sorry we’ve been so quiet for so long, but there’s going to be cool, exciting stuff happening in the coming months, and we want you to be part of it. </p>
