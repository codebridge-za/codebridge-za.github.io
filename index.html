                <h2>What is {code}bridge?</h2>
                <p>We are a civic tech incubator, but we are also a great deal more than that.</p>

                <p>Incubators generally exist to find and develop technology start-ups. {code}bridge takes it a step further, by drawing from our community. We foster creative engagement between those who understand the problems, typically civil society and government, and those who have the technological skills that can help solve them.</p>

                <p>Our mission is therefore to bridge the gap between grassroots activism, technology and data.</p>

                <p>The {code}bridge philosophy aims to bring together activists, technologists, journalists, data analysts, designers, programmers and others, to create opportunities for innovations and alternative ways to address some of society's challenges. </p>

                <p>In short, we want to use civic technology to improve lives through efficiency and transparency, connecting citizens to service.</p>
