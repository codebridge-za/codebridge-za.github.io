<h2>Local Budget Dataquest</h2>
<h4><span class="label label-success">23 April 2016</span></h4>
<p>Government budgets are a blueprint for how public resources are going to be used in order to satisfy public needs. Transparent budgets, expenditure and revenues, and other financial data enable people to access information on the sources of revenue and understand how that money is spent.</p>

<p>The National Treasury through its City Support Programme is seeking to open municipal financial data and make it widely available in order to strengthen civic oversight and public accountability as well as to promote entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>We love open data! We are assisting the National Treasury in the process and want to get you involved too. Malijeng Ngqaleni, Deputy Director General (DDG) of Intergovernmental Relations at the South African National Treasury explains how they are opening up municipal finance database. This will allow civil society to help improve municipal performance by holding them to account.</p>

<h4>Local Municipal Budget Workshops</h4>
<p>We hosted three Local Municipal Budget Workshops on 12 April 2016 to define the focus areas for this project. Much of the data we discussed that day is available on <a href="http://mfma.treasury.gov.za/Media_Releases/s71/1516/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Treasuryâ€™s website</a>. Here are the session handout and the presentations about what budget information is available and how budget data can be used to hold governments accountable and improve service delivery:</p>
