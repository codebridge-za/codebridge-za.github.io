            <p>The income from membership fees is enough to cover the basics, but we survive off donations. It can be cash, furniture or time. Here is a current list of some items we're looking for:</p>

                    Since we're entirely member-run there are whole lot of random jobs to do around the building (you know - taking out trash, etc.). This website also needs some work (and <a href="https://github.com/codebridge-za/codebridge-za.github.io">its on github!</a>)
