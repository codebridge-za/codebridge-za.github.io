<h2>Code4SA</h2>

<p>Code for South Africa (Code4SA) uses civic technology to promote informed decision-making and drive social change. Located at Codebridge, Code4SA is first and foremost a civic technology organisation. We believe that technology, used effectively, can increase transparency in government, promote an active citizenry and contribute to achieving a more just society by empowering ordinary citizens to make informed decisions about their lives. </p>

<p>In partnership with MAVC (Make All Voices Heard) and Innovation Edge, the Codebridge project aims by creating a community to solve such complex issues, while leveraging off the expertise of Code4SA.<p>
