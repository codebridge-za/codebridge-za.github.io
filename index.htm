  <h2>Our Sponsors</h2>
    <p>We are very grateful to be sponsored by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>
    who cover the rent of the building.</p>

    <p>Our current internet sponsor is <a href="http://www.snapbill.com">SnapBill</a>, though
    we're always looking for an upgrade. Did someone say fibre?</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

  <p>
    The income membership fee is enough to cover the basics, but we survive off
    donations.
  </p>

<h3>Projector</h3>
  <p>
      We are currently borrowing a projector for most events, but it
      would be great to have our own.
  </p>

<h3>Desks and Chairs</h3>
  <p>
      We have had a fair amount of desks and chairs donated already, but we're
      always looking for more. Really anything goes - old plastic chairs are
      very useful for overflow seating at events.
  </p>

<h3>Programming Books</h3>
  <p>
      It would be great to build up a collection of programming books. We've
      always looking for more. Feel free to swap any of the books on the
      shelf with one from your home (but please bring it back after a while.)
  </p>

		<h3>Whiteboards</h3>
  <p>
      It seems we can never have enough. We ideally want some large wall sized ones,
      but the smaller ones are useful too.
  </p>


<h3>Your Time</h3>
  <p>
      Since we're entirely member-run there are whole lot of random jobs
      to do around the building (you know - taking out trash, etc.). This
      website also needs some work (and
      <a href="https://github.com/codebridge-za/codebridge-za.github.io">its on github!</a>)
