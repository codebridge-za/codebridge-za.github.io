            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>We are <strong>literally</strong> inside the Campground road bridge which goes over the railway line in Claremont. We are on the <strong>same side of the railway as Main rd</strong>, and our parking lot is on the <strong>opposite side of Campground rd to Pick'n'Pay.</strong> You can punch Codebridge into Google maps and it should find us. Also, look out for signs to the new Park Inn hotel. We are diagonally across from there.</p>

            <p>You can get to the parking lot by following Hemlock Street which is just off Claremont Boulvard. The parking lot is a large gravel parking lot directly adjacent to the bridge. Just follow the arrows on the map below!</p>

            <p>The entrance is at the back corner furthest from Main Road once you're inside the parking lot. Just look out for the Codebridge sign on the wall.</p>
